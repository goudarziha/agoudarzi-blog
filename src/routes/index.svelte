<p>
	Hello, I'm Amir. I'm a full stack developer and entrepeneur who's started multiple projects and
	ran them to the ground.
</p>

<p>
	If you are on the site, you are probably like-minded and are constantly coming up with project
	ideas. I have a large text file I constantly update with these ideas, and I am guessing you have
	one of those lists too.
</p>

<p>
	A couple problems I have is that I have too many ideas and only so much time to start and see a
	project to completion. Another problem is documenting my journey on those projects to be able to
	look back on.
</p>

<p>
	A couple goals for this site is some accountability for these projects to continually ship and
	document that journey.
</p>

<p>
	You can check up on my progress on my <a href="/projects">Projects</a> page.
