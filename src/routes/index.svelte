	<h2>Hi, I'm Amir</h2>

	<p>
		I am a software engineer by day and an aspiring entrepenur by night. I have a lot of things
		going on that I don't document, so this will be a space to write about that and keep a record
		of. I start a lot of projects that just collect dust, that I have learned a lot along the way,
		the hard way. So if someone else can get some value out of my failures, this will have served
		its purpose
	</p>

	<p>
		I am very interested in financial markets and combining that passion with my technicals skills
		as a developer, I hope to create a solid portfolio of Algorithmic systems to trade across
		various capital markets.
	</p>

	<p>I am also very interested in SaaS products, so I will also write about my ideas here.</p>

	<p>
		If you have found this site, you are probably pretty like-minded and having a lot of
		ideas/projects that get written down, but don't get to see the light of day. This is an issue I
		wanted to solve for myself, so here we are. Join me and my journey
	</p>

	<p>
		You can check up on my progress on my <a href="/projects">Projects</a> page.
