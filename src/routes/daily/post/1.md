This is my first post on this new blog. I also did something I tell myself I would never do when starting a new project I want to keep up with and that is using a brand new framework. That framework is [Svelte](https://svelte.dev). I am already in love with Svelte and glad I took a stab at making this site with it. I was able to get the backbones to the site up in a matter of hours.

I am also breaking the site up into a few different parts to make it easier to keep up with. The daily blogs like here will be home to small writings that I will try and keep up with more. The main blog site will be more in-depth with things I am currently working on. I will try to do some guides (like how to put up and host a markdown blog in Svelte quickly). The main reason for this site is to document my journey as a solo SaaS founder. Currently have 1 project up [Anlytics](https://anlytics.co) and in the process of starting another quick one [Affiliate List](https://affiliatelist.co).

These dailes aren't going to be in depth by any means, but just more random writings. Thanks for reading!
